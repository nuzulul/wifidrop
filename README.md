# WIFIDrop

WIFIDrop is an easy-to-use progressive web app (PWA) that allows users to transfer files between devices on the same network. Files are transferred securely peer-to-peer via WebRTC without any intermediary servers. WebRTC works by leveraging existing public infrastructure for signaling such as Torrent, Nostr and MQTT. Therefore this application can be run on static hosting.
