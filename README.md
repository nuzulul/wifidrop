# WIFIDrop

Local peer-to-peer file transfer via WIFI.

WIFIDrop is an easy-to-use progressive web app (PWA) that allows users to transfer unlimited size of files between devices over the same WIFI network. Files are transferred securely peer-to-peer via WebRTC without any intermediary servers. Therefore this application is a completely client side application and can be run on any static hosting or local host.
